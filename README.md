# From Ruby to Node.js: A Brief Introduction

## What is Node.js?

* History
* Explanation of everything Node packages together

## Why Node.js?

* What makes Node.js different from Ruby and other programming languages.
* The allure of Universal JavaScript (Polymorphic JavaScript)
* NPM and the JavaScript community
* Demand, demand, demand

## Let's (kind of) Get Started!

* Downloading Node through the website or NVM
* Using npm (starting a node project with ```npm init```)
* Explaining node_modules
* The very simple ```console.log('Hello World')```

## A Slightly Less Contrived Hello World!
* Requiring a module
* A quick rundown of ES6 (```const```, ```let```, ```() =>```)
* Reading from a file synchronously.
* Reading from a file asynchronously.
* Explaining the event loop, events and asynchronous programming

## Hello World On The World Wide Web!
* Express is kind of like Sinatra. Except for all the curly brackets and semi-colons.

* Not sure if I'll get to this
